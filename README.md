# DES-Python
Use S-P Box Generator to generate tables for particular block size. Set the block size to 16,32,64 and then run. Copy its output.

Now open Des-Modified.py then replace the tables lines with the copeid ones. On the bottom of file set the block size and rounds.

Then Run!

PS : Keep the length of plaintext to be a multiple of 8. I'll add padding and avalanche effect later.
